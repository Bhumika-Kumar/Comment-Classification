This repository contains a comprehensive system for classifying social media comments into various predefined categories. The system is designed to manage and streamline 
comment interactions by categorizing comments, removing toxic content, and providing automated responses based on comment classification. 


Steps for the Automated System
Data Collection:

Collect a dataset of social media comments that include examples of each category.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., remove special characters, normalize text).
Feature Extraction:

Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Training:

Train a multi-class classifier to categorize comments. You can use models like XGBoost, BERT, or any other suitable classifier.
Toxic Comment Removal:

Implement a toxicity detection model to filter out toxic comments before classification.
Automated Responses:

Set up predefined responses for each category to automate responses to comments.
Integration:

Integrate the classification and response system into your application.
